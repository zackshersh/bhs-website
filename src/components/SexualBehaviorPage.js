                    <p>The Sexual Behavior Program at Behavioral Health Solutions provides evaluation and treatment for people with a wide range of problematic sexual behaviors and sexual interests.</p> 

                    <p>We provide treatment for people struggling with a variety of sexual behavior problems, such as excessive pornography use, sexual abuse of children, sexual assault of adults, voyeurism (peeping), exhibitionism (exposing), and possession or use of child sexual abuse materials (child pornography).  We also provide treatment for people experiencing unwanted and/or problematic sexual interests, such as sexual interests in minors and sexual fetishes.</p>  

                    <p>Some of our clients have been court-ordered to receive sex offender treatment.  Others have been referred by another professional or an agency, such as Department of Social Services.  Other clients are concerned about their sexual behavior, thoughts, or feelings and contact us directly.  Services are available for children (ages 11 and older), adolescents, and adults.   We approach our clients’ needs with respect, professionalism, and high ethical standards.</p>
