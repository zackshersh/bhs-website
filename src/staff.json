        "bio": ["I am a licensed psychologist.  I work with adults who have a wide range of problems, including depression, anxiety, anger and relationship difficulties.  I specialize in the evaluation and treatment of individuals with sexual behavior problems.  I understand that it can be difficult to seek help.  When people are trying to find help, itâ€™s my goal to do what I can to make their efforts worthwhile.  I bring compassion, respect, and knowledge to my work.  I try to understand who my clients are, while helping them with their difficulties and appreciating their strengths.","I received my doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Before opening Behavioral Health Solutions, P.A. in April 2004, I worked in the North Carolina Department of Corrections and at Dorothea Dix Hospital.   I am a member of the American Psychological Association, the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, and the North Carolina Association for the Management and Treatment of Sex Offenders."]
